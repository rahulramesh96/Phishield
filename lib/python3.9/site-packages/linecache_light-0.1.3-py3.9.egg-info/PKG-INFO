    LineCache caches the line position of a file in the memory. Everytime it access a line, it will seek to the related postion and readline().
    Noticing that it may cost some time when you first cache lines of a file.

    Usage:

        from linecache_light import LineCache

        linecache = LineCache('a.txt', cache_suffix='.cache')

        num_lines = len(linecache)

        line_0 = linecache[0]

        line_100 = linecache[100]

        line_indexing= linecache[[2,3,4,5]]

        line_indexing = linecache[-1]
